        Global warming is accelerating, with global land and ocean temperatures now more than 1°C above
        the pre-industrial baseline. As the Arctic warms nearly four times faster than the rest of the world,
        rapid declines in summer sea-ice extent open major shipping corridors such as the Northern Sea Route
        (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP). However, expanding traffic introduces new risks that extend beyond
        ice and weather—specifically, geomagnetic instability that can degrade navigation accuracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using long-term temperature and sea-ice records, shipping activity data, and magnetic-field gradient
        maps from the WMM2025 model, we compare where magnetic instability overlaps major Arctic routes.
        Results show that shipping corridors often pass through areas of steep magnetic inclination and
        high field variability, conditions known to degrade GNSS accuracy and compass-based heading systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        These findings suggest that Arctic navigation safety requires integrating geomagnetic-risk assessment
        alongside sea-ice forecasting. As the Arctic continues to open, safe navigation will depend not only
        on ice-free waters but also on a reliable magnetic-signal environment.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

    <p>
      The Arctic is warming rapidly, driving declines in summer sea-ice that open hidden waters previously
      inaccessible to ships. As shipping corridors such as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage become
      more navigable, concerns arise regarding the Arctic’s unstable magnetic environment, which may reduce
      GNSS navigation accuracy.

          <p>
            Coordinates for Arctic shipping routes were extracted from maritime charts and high-latitude
            datasets. Magnetic-field data was obtained from WMM2025, developed by NOAA & the British Geological Survey.

          <h3 class="title is-5">2. Magnetic Computation</h3>
          <p>
            Using geomag in Python, we computed magnetic inclination and the magnetic-field gradient across
            a uniform high-latitude grid. Each grid point received repeated magnetic-field calculations.

          <p>
            With Matplotlib + Cartopy, we produced polar-projection maps showing magnetic variability.
            Arctic routes (NSR & NWP) were overlaid to identify intersections with instability hotspots.

            Areas with strong magnetic variation appear darker on the maps, indicating increased risk where
            GPS, satellite navigation, and radio communication may degrade.

        polar-navigation research. Although synthetic, the spatial patterns reflect real documented risks.

      • Real GNSS-error data is limited due to sparse satellite coverage and restricted datasets.<br>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Mapping Arctic magnetic instability reveals high-risk zones where the NSR and NWP overlap steep
      magnetic gradients. As the Arctic opens to international shipping, ensuring safe navigation will
      require both sea-ice monitoring and real-time geomagnetic-environment awareness.
