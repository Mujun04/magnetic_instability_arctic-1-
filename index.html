    <p>
      The Arctic is warming rapidly, and as summer sea-ice melts, major shipping routes such as the Northern Sea Route (NSR)
      and the Northwest Passage (NWP) are opening for longer periods. While this creates new opportunities, it also introduces
      a lesser-known challenge: <strong>magnetic-field instability</strong>, which can reduce the accuracy of GNSS navigation.

  <p>
    We analyzed magnetic inclination and magnetic-field gradient data from WMM2025 to identify hotspot regions
    across the Arctic. These hotspots represent areas where Earth’s magnetic field changes quickly, which can
    interfere with GNSS signals, compass heading, and even radio communication. When we overlaid Arctic
    shipping routes on the hotspot map, several segments of both the NSR and NWP passed directly through
    high-variability regions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because available GNSS degradation data in the Arctic is limited, we created a simulation-based GNSS error
    density model using known physical relationships from polar-navigation research. Our results show that
    GNSS vulnerability increases where magnetic gradients are strongest.
  </p>

  <p>
    These findings suggest that as Arctic shipping expands, vessels will require not only ice-free waters but
    also improved GNSS correction systems and real-time awareness of magnetic-field changes and space-weather
    conditions.

    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Introduction</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Recent climate observations show that the Arctic is warming much faster than the global average.
      As ocean temperatures rise, summer sea-ice continues to decline, revealing open-water areas that were once
      inaccessible. This transformation is making the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP)
      more viable as commercial shipping corridors.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      As summer sea-ice declines (Figure 2), once-blocked Arctic waters open during the warmer months.
      This seasonal melting is the key factor enabling the potential commercial use of the NSR and NWP.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      However, the Arctic is also a region where Earth’s magnetic field becomes highly unstable.
      Steep magnetic inclination and rapid magnetic-field changes can reduce GNSS accuracy, making reliable
      navigation more challenging even when sea-ice has receded. Understanding how these magnetic hotspots 
      overlap with emerging shipping routes is therefore essential for Arctic navigation safety.

    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Results</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Magnetic inclination becomes extremely steep in high-latitude regions, creating conditions where heading sensors
      and magnetic compasses are less stable.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Magnetic-field gradients highlight areas where the magnetic field changes rapidly. These regions often coincide with
      known GNSS instability zones identified in previous polar-navigation studies.

      Because real GNSS degradation data is sparse, we created a simulation-model that amplifies GNSS error where magnetic
      gradients are steep. The results show clear increases in GNSS uncertainty along segments of both the NSR and NWP.

<!-- DISCUSSION -->
<section class="section has-background-light">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Discussion</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      As sea-ice retreat improves the physical accessibility of Arctic waters, magnetic instability poses a new,
      less visible challenge. GNSS accuracy can degrade significantly in areas with steep magnetic-field gradients,
      especially during geomagnetic disturbances. These navigation uncertainties are particularly important in harsh
      Arctic environments where visibility may be limited and alternative navigation tools are harder to rely on.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Our maps show that some parts of the NSR and NWP have increased GNSS position errors where they overlap magnetic-field
      hotspots. Ships traveling through these regions may require upgraded GNSS corrections, multi-constellation receivers,
      or alternative navigation technologies. As Arctic shipping expands, real-time monitoring of magnetic-field variations
      and space weather will become essential for safe navigation.
