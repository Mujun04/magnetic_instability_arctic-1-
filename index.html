<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">Abstract</h2>

  <div class="abstract-box">
    <p>
      As the Arctic warms at unprecedented speed, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP) are becoming seasonally navigable.
      Yet the opening of these corridors introduces a less visible risk: geomagnetic instability. Steep magnetic inclination and rapidly changing
      magnetic-field gradients weaken GNSS accuracy, distort compass readings, and disrupt radio communication—posing navigational challenges
      even in fully ice-free waters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using long-term temperature and sea-ice datasets, Arctic route coordinates, and geomagnetic outputs from the World Magnetic Model (WMM2025),
      this study identifies regions where magnetic instability overlaps with major Arctic shipping pathways. These hotspots highlight where vessels
      may experience increased positional drift or degraded heading reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The results emphasize that safe Arctic navigation must integrate geomagnetic conditions alongside sea-ice forecasts. As physical accessibility
      increases, shipping success will depend not only on ice-free waters but also on maintaining a stable magnetic-signal environment.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">The Changing Arctic</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Global temperatures have risen more than 1°C above pre-industrial levels, with the Arctic warming nearly
    four times faster than the global average. As summer sea-ice continues to decline, the NSR and NWP have become
    increasingly accessible, prompting commercial interest from shipping companies seeking shorter transit routes
    between Asia, Europe, and North America.
  </div>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Previous research has primarily focused on sea-ice hazards, vessel icing, and weather-related risks. However,
    navigation challenges linked to the Arctic’s geomagnetic environment have received far less attention. The region
    exhibits steep magnetic inclination, strong magnetic gradients, and frequent space-weather activity—conditions that
    degrade GNSS accuracy, destabilize compass-based heading systems, and weaken radio communication.
  </div>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    With maritime traffic expected to rise in newly open waters, understanding how geomagnetic instability interacts with
    sea-ice loss has become essential. This study explores where magnetic hotspots intersect emerging Arctic shipping
    corridors and evaluates their implications for navigation safety and route planning.
  </div>

<!-- WHY ROUTES MATTER -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">Why the Arctic Routes Matter</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    As Arctic ice retreats, two strategic shipping corridors—the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP)—are becoming seasonally
    accessible. These routes can shorten travel distances between Asia, Europe, and North America by thousands of kilometers.
  </div>

  <figure>
    <img src="./static/images/arctic_routes.png" class="centered-img">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;">
      <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Key Arctic shipping corridors: the NSR and the NWP.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Shorter transit times translate to lower fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and major economic advantages.
    However, these benefits depend on safe and reliable navigation—an increasingly complex challenge in the Arctic’s
    magnetically unstable environment.
  </div>
</section>


<!-- THE HIDDEN PROBLEM -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">The Hidden Navigation Problem</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Beneath the newly opened waters lies a critical but less visible risk: magnetic instability. Near the poles, Earth's magnetic field
    dips steeply downward and shifts rapidly across short distances—conditions that weaken compass reliability, distort GNSS, and increase
    positional drift in high-latitude environments.
  </div>

  <figure>
    <img src="./static/images/magnetic_inclination.png" class="centered-img">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;">
      <strong>Figure 4.</strong> Magnetic inclination across the Arctic.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    For vessels traveling through the NSR or NWP, these conditions mean that even in ice-free situations, navigation uncertainty can increase
    without warning. This risk is often underestimated in policy and industry discussions, yet it directly affects safety and route planning.
  </div>
</section>


<!-- WHAT THE MAPS REVEAL -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">What the Maps Reveal</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    By overlaying magnetic-field gradients with Arctic shipping routes, we identified specific regions where GNSS reliability is expected to degrade.
    These “hotspots” represent areas where the magnetic field changes quickly, making satellite-based positioning less stable.
  </div>

  <figure>
    <img src="./static/images/magnetic_hotspots.png" class="centered-img">
    <figcaption style="text-align:center; margin-top:10px;">
      <strong>Figure 5.</strong> Magnetic-field gradient hotspots.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Together, these patterns show that future Arctic shipping is not just about melted sea-ice—magnetic instability will shape how safely and efficiently
    vessels can navigate these newly opened waters.
  </div>
</section>



<!-- SEA ICE X MAGNETIC -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">Sea-Ice Loss & Magnetic Instability</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    As climate change accelerates Arctic warming, newly open waters coincide with some of the most geomagnetically unstable parts of the region.
    Areas that lose sea-ice earliest—such as the Laptev Sea, Kara Sea, and Canadian Arctic Archipelago—often align with steep magnetic gradients.
    This overlap creates a paradox: while the Arctic becomes easier to enter physically, it does not necessarily become safer to navigate.
  </div>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    Even in ice-free conditions, vessels may experience increased GNSS drift, unstable satellite communication, and compass deviation. These factors
    highlight the need to integrate geomagnetic risk into Arctic route planning rather than relying solely on sea-ice forecasts.
  </div>
</section>



<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">Methodology</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">

    <strong>1. Data Collection</strong><br>
    Coordinates for the NSR and NWP were obtained from publicly available maritime datasets. Magnetic-field values (inclination, intensity, and
    gradient) were sourced from the World Magnetic Model (WMM2025), published by NOAA and the British Geological Survey.

    <br><br>

    <strong>2. Magnetic-Field Computation</strong><br>
    Using Python, the Arctic region was divided into a uniform grid. For each grid point, magnetic inclination and magnetic-field gradients were computed
    using WMM2025 model coefficients. These variables were used to identify zones of rapid magnetic variability—areas most associated with GNSS degradation.

    <br><br>

    <strong>3. Visualization</strong><br>
    Arctic maps were produced using Matplotlib and Cartopy with a polar projection centered on the magnetic pole. A gradient-based colormap highlighted
    areas of magnetic instability. Shipping routes were then overlaid to identify where navigation corridors intersect high-risk zones.

    <br><br>

    <strong>4. Interpretation</strong><br>
    Regions with steep gradients or high magnetic inclination were classified as magnetic hotspots. When major Arctic routes passed through these hotspots,
    the areas were flagged as potential GNSS-error or compass-deviation zones.

  </div>
</section>



<!-- ECONOMIC IMPACT -->
<section class="section fade-section">
  <h2 class="title">Economic Implications</h2>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    The NSR and NWP offer substantial economic benefits by reducing Asia–Europe transit distance by up to 40%. However, magnetic instability introduces
    operational risks that can offset these gains. Positional drift, degraded radar alignment, and communication instability may force vessels to slow
    down, alter course, or rely more heavily on icebreaker guidance.
  </div>

  <div class="arctic-box">
    These uncertainties increase fuel use, insurance costs, and transit variability. For LNG carriers and commercial vessels operating in shallow Arctic
    shelf seas, small navigation errors can rapidly escalate into grounding or collision risks. Thus, long-term economic viability depends not only on
    melting sea-ice but also on improving navigation reliability in magnetically unstable regions.
