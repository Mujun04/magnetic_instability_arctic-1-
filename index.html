    <p>
      Global warming is accelerating, and the Arctic is now warming nearly four times faster than the global average.
      As temperatures rise and summer sea-ice rapidly declines, new shipping corridors such as the Northern Sea Route
      (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP) are becoming seasonally navigable, attracting commercial and strategic interest.
      Yet as Arctic navigation expands, new risks emerge that extend beyond ice and weather.

      <p>
        This study examines the often-overlooked influence of geomagnetic instability on Arctic maritime navigation.
        Using long-term sea-ice data, temperature anomalies, historic shipping activity, and magnetic-field gradient
        maps derived from the WMM2025 model, we identify locations where magnetic instability overlaps active shipping
        corridors. Results show that major Arctic routes intersect zones with steep magnetic inclination and rapid
        spatial magnetic variation—conditions known to degrade GNSS accuracy, distort compass readings, and disrupt
        radio communication. These risks increase during geomagnetic storms, potentially raising collision and
        grounding probability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our findings highlight that a safe future for Arctic navigation requires more than ice-free waters—it requires
        stable access to accurate magnetic-signal environments. Integrating geomagnetic risk assessment alongside
        sea-ice forecasting will be critical as polar shipping continues to expand throughout the 21st century.

<!-- INTRODUCTION (expanded + figure reorganization) -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      The Arctic has undergone dramatic environmental transformation over the past several decades. Global mean
      temperatures continue to rise, and the high latitudes are warming at nearly quadruple the global rate.
      Figure 1 illustrates this persistent temperature increase since the 19th century.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="has-text-centered">Figure 1. Global land and ocean temperature anomalies since 1850.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      As a result, summer sea-ice extent has steadily decreased (Figure 2), unlocking previously inaccessible
      maritime areas. These newly opened waters form the basis of emerging shipping corridors, including the NSR
      along Russia’s northern coast and the NWP across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Figure 3).

      <figcaption class="has-text-centered">Figure 3. Arctic shipping routes enabled by declining sea-ice.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      However, increasing accessibility does not guarantee safe navigation. The Arctic is also home to some of the
      most magnetically unstable regions on Earth, where the magnetic field changes rapidly over short distances.
      Such variations can impair GNSS accuracy, distort compass-based heading systems, and reduce communication
      reliability—all crucial components of safe maritime operation.

            Coordinates for Arctic shipping corridors (NSR, NWP) were extracted from maritime navigation charts
            and polar-route datasets. Temperature and sea-ice records were obtained from NOAA and ESA.
            Magnetic-field data was sourced from the World Magnetic Model 2025 (WMM2025).

<!-- RESULTS (expanded + reordered text/figures) -->

    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Results</h2>

    <p>
      The Arctic features numerous areas where the magnetic field tilts sharply (high inclination).
      Figure 4 illustrates these patterns, showing that both the NSR and NWP intersect zones with
      stronger-than-average inclination shifts.

      <figcaption class="has-text-centered">Figure 4. Magnetic inclination across the Arctic (WMM2025).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      When magnetic-field gradient is mapped (Figure 5), clear hotspots emerge—particularly north of Siberia
      and near parts of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. These hotspots represent regions where magnetic
      variation changes quickly over short distances.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Because real GNSS degradation datasets for the Arctic are not publicly available, we created a simulation-based
      GNSS error density map (Figure 6). The model increases expected GNSS error near areas with steep magnetic gradients
      following patterns established in existing polar-navigation literature.

<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
<section class="section has-background-light">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      • GNSS-error datasets for the Arctic are limited due to sparse satellite reception and commercial restrictions.<br>
      • Figure 6 is simulation-based, though grounded in documented Arctic navigation challenges.<br>
      • Higher-resolution magnetic modeling and integration of AIS logs would further improve accuracy.<br>

<!-- CONCLUSION (expanded) -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      As climate warming accelerates and sea-ice loss opens new maritime pathways, the Arctic is rapidly transforming
      into an international shipping arena. However, this increased accessibility occurs alongside a more subtle hazard:
      geomagnetic instability. Our analysis shows that both the NSR and NWP intersect zones where magnetic inclination
      shifts dramatically and magnetic-field gradients intensify.
    </p>

    <p>
      These conditions can degrade GNSS accuracy, impair heading reliability, and complicate communication—risks that
      become especially severe during geomagnetic storms. As a result, the future of Arctic navigation will require a
      dual-core approach: **accurate sea-ice forecasting + reliable geomagnetic-risk monitoring**.
