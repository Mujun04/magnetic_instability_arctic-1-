    <p>
      The Arctic is warming rapidly, and as summer sea-ice melts, major shipping routes such as
      the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP) are opening for longer periods.
      While this creates new opportunities, it also introduces a lesser-known challenge:
      <strong>magnetic-field instability</strong>, which can reduce GNSS accuracy.

      <p>
        We analyzed magnetic inclination and magnetic-field gradient data from WMM2025 to identify hotspot regions
        across the Arctic. These hotspots represent areas where Earth’s magnetic field changes quickly, which can
        interfere with GNSS signals, compass heading, and radio communication. When we overlaid Arctic
        shipping routes on the hotspot map, several segments of both the NSR and NWP passed directly through
        high-variability regions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because available GNSS degradation data in the Arctic is limited, we created a simulation-based GNSS error
        density model using known physical relationships from polar-navigation research. Our results show that
        GNSS vulnerability increases where magnetic gradients are strongest.
      </p>

      <p>
        These findings suggest that as Arctic shipping expands, vessels will require not only ice-free waters but
        also improved GNSS correction systems and real-time awareness of magnetic-field changes and space-weather
        conditions.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Introduction</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Recent climate observations show that the Arctic is warming much faster than the global average.
      As ocean temperatures rise, summer sea-ice continues to decline, revealing open-water areas that were once
      inaccessible. This transformation is making the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP)
      more viable as commercial shipping corridors.

    </figure>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      As summer sea-ice declines (Figure 2), once-blocked Arctic waters open during the warmer months.
      This seasonal melting is the key factor enabling the potential commercial use of the NSR and NWP.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      However, the Arctic is also a region where Earth’s magnetic field becomes highly unstable.
      Steep magnetic inclination and rapid magnetic-field changes can reduce GNSS accuracy, making reliable
      navigation more challenging even when sea-ice has receded. Understanding how these magnetic hotspots 
      overlap with emerging shipping routes is therefore essential for Arctic navigation safety.

        <li><strong>Magnetic Gradient</strong> — How rapidly the magnetic field changes across short distances. High gradients destabilize headings and GNSS signals.</li>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Magnetic inclination becomes extremely steep in high-latitude regions, creating conditions where heading sensors
      and magnetic compasses are less stable.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Magnetic-field gradients highlight areas where the magnetic field changes rapidly. These regions often coincide with
      known GNSS instability zones identified in previous polar-navigation studies.

<!-- DATASETS & TOOLS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Datasets & Tools</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      <p>
        This project combines climate, sea-ice, and magnetic-field datasets from published scientific sources.
        Global temperature trends were taken from Berkeley Earth and NOAA anomaly records. Sea-ice extent data was obtained
        from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Arctic shipping-route geometries were referenced from ESA
        maritime maps, and Earth’s magnetic-field values were computed using the World Magnetic Model (WMM2025).
      </p>
      <p>
        Data analysis and visualization were performed with Python, using Cartopy for polar projections and Matplotlib for plotting.
        GNSS error density was generated using a physics-based simulation informed by known polar-navigation research and
        publicly available Arctic shipping datasets.

<!-- LIMITATIONS -->
<section class="section has-background-light">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Limitations</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      <p>
        Real GNSS error measurements in the Arctic are limited because few vessels operate in high-latitude waters,
        and many navigation datasets are restricted. As a result, our GNSS instability map relies partly on simulation
        guided by known magnetic-field physics and polar-navigation studies. Higher-resolution, seasonally updated datasets
        would improve future accuracy.

<!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Why It Matters</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      <p>
        As the Arctic becomes increasingly accessible, even small navigation errors may lead to grounding, collision risks,
        or delayed passages in remote regions where rescue capability is limited. Identifying areas where magnetic instability
        overlaps with shipping routes helps vessels prepare using GNSS corrections, multi-constellation systems, and
        real-time magnetic and space-weather monitoring. Understanding these risks supports safer Arctic operations
        and future policy planning.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Our maps show that some parts of the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage have increased GNSS position errors
      where they overlap magnetic-field hotspots. Ships traveling through these regions may require upgraded GNSS systems,
      alternative navigation methods, and real-time monitoring of magnetic variations and space weather.
