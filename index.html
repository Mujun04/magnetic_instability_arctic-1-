    <p>
      The Arctic is warming rapidly, and as summer sea-ice melts, major shipping routes like
      the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP) are opening for longer periods.
      While this creates new economic opportunities, it also exposes ships to a less visible
      but important risk: <strong>magnetic-field instability</strong>, which can weaken GNSS
      accuracy.
    </p>

      <p>
        We used the World Magnetic Model (WMM2025) to map where magnetic inclination and
        magnetic-field gradients change sharply across the Arctic. These hotspots are regions
        where Earth's magnetic field shifts quickly—something known to disturb GNSS signals,
        compass heading, and even radio communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        By overlaying shipping routes on these hotspot maps, we found that several parts of
        both NSR and NWP run directly through areas of steep magnetic variation. Because
        real GNSS error logs in the Arctic are limited, we built a simulation-based GNSS
        error model that follows patterns from polar-navigation studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our analysis shows that magnetic hotspots strongly align with areas of increased
        GNSS vulnerability. As Arctic traffic grows, safe navigation will require not only
        ice-free waters but also <strong>real-time awareness of magnetic-signal stability
        and space-weather conditions</strong>.

    <div class="arctic-box">
      As the Arctic warms almost four times faster than the rest of the world, summer
      sea-ice is shrinking rapidly. This change is opening long-blocked passages,
      allowing cargo ships to travel shorter distances between Asia, Europe, and North America.
      However, the Arctic's magnetic environment is extremely unstable, making reliable
      navigation—as important as avoiding sea-ice—much more challenging.

    </figure>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Sea-ice loss (Figure 2) means ships can now pass through the NSR and NWP more frequently.
      Yet these routes also cross regions where Earth's magnetic field tilts sharply downward
      or changes rapidly over short distances. These shifts can distort compass readings and
      weaken GNSS accuracy.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section class="section has-background-light">
  <div class="container is-max-desktop">
    <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="arctic-box">
      Our maps show that some parts of the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage
      have larger GNSS position errors where they cross magnetic-field hotspots.
      As Arctic shipping increases, vessels traveling through these zones may need:
      <ul>
        <li>Upgraded GNSS correction tools</li>
        <li>Alternative navigation systems (radar, inertial sensors)</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring of magnetic-field changes</li>
        <li>Space-weather alerts to avoid peak geomagnetic disturbances</li>
      </ul>
      The future of Arctic shipping depends not only on ice-free seas but also on
      stable magnetic-signal environments.
